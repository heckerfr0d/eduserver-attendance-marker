# eduserver-attendance-marker

A simple python script to automate attendance marking on iium ita'leem.

## Requirements

1. Python 3
2. Mechanize

## Installation

1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Mechanize : `pip3 install mechanize`

## Usage

1. Solo: Enter your ita'leem login details in `attendance-solo.py`, execute using `python3 attendance-solo.py` and, if you're doing it on a cloud server, never worry about being excused ever again. :smirk:

**Note:** You have to execute it before the 1st class of the day starts (can be the previous night) for it to work.

## Disclaimer

This script checks for attendance slots every minute in the specified intervals. Since this is kinda wasteful, any idea to improve on this algorithm is welcome. Also, use at your own risk etc.
